=== Required Prerequisite Algorithms for RSA Validations

Each RSA implementation relies on other cryptographic primitives. For example, RSA keyGen often uses an underlying SHA algorithm. Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the same submission. ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

[[prereqs_table]]
.Required RSA Prerequisite Algorithms JSON Values
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type | Valid Values

| algorithm | a prerequisite algorithm | string | SHA, DRBG
| valValue | algorithm validation number| string | Actual number or "same"
| prereqAlgVal | prerequisite algorithm validation | object with algorithm and valValue properties | See above
|===

=== RSA Algorithm Registration Properties

Each RSA algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object using the following values.

[[rsa_caps_table]]
.RSA Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type | Valid Values

| algorithm | The RSA algorithm to be validated | string | See <<supported>>
| mode | The mode to be validated | string | See <<supported>>
| revision | The algorithm testing revision to use | string | See <<supported>>
| prereqVals | Prerequisite algorithm validations | array of prereqAlgVal objects | See <<prereq_algs>>
| capabilities | The individual RSA capabilities | array of capability objects | See <<rsa_keyGen_capabilities>>, <<rsa_sigGen_capabilities>>, <<rsa_sigVer_capabilities>>, <<rsa_decprim_capabilities>>, or <<rsa_sigprim_capabilities>>
| infoGeneratedByServer | This flag indicates that the server is responsible for generating inputs for Key Generation tests | boolean | true/false
| pubExpMode | Supports fixed or random public key exponent e | string | "fixed" or "random"
| fixedPubExp | The value of the public key exponent e in hex if pubExpMode is "fixed" | hex |
| keyFormat | The preferred private key format. The "standard" format has "p", "q", and "d" as the components of the private key. The "crt" (Chinese Remainder Theorem) format has "p", "q", "dmp1" (d modulo p-1), "dmq1" (d modulo q-1), and "iqmp" (inverse q modulo p) as the components | string | "standard" or "crt"

NOTE: The 'infoGeneratedByServer' property is only valid for RSA / keyGen / * registrations.

NOTE: The properties 'pubExpMode` and `fixedPubExp` are only valid for RSA / decryptionPrimitive / Sp800-56Br2, RSA / keyGen / * , and RSA / sigVer / * registrations.

NOTE: The 'keyFormat' property is only valid for RSA / decryptionPrimitive / Sp800-56Br2, and RSA / keyGen / * registrations.
