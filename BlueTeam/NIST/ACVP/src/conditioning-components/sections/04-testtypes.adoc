== Test Types and Test Coverage

This section describes the design of the tests used to validate implementations of Conditioning Components.

=== Test Types

There is one test-type for Conditioning Components: Algorithm Functional Tests. The testType field definitions are:

* "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test. These tests can be processed by the client using a normal 'MAC', or 'derive' operation. AFTs cause the implementation under test to exercise nomral operations on a single block, multiple blocks, or partial blocks. In all cases,random data is used. The functional tests are designed to verify that the logical components of the cryptographic implementation (block chunking, block padding etc.) are operating correctly.
