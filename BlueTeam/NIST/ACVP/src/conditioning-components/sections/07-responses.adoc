== Test Vector Responses

After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must send the response vectors back to the ACVP server. The following table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set response.

.Response JSON Object
|===
| JSON Property | Description | JSON Type

| acvVersion | The version of the protocol | string
| vsId | The vector set identifier | integer
| testGroups | The test group data, see <<response_group_table>> | array
|===

An example of this is the following

[source, json]
----
{
    "acvVersion": "version",
    "vsId": 1,
    "testGroups": [ ... ]
}
----

The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors. Several algorithms *SHALL* require the client to send back group level properties in their response. This structure helps accommodate that. The following is a skeleton for the test group structure. Additional properties may be included at this level depending on the algorithm, mode and revision.

.Response Test Group JSON Objects
|===
| JSON Property | Description | JSON Type

| tgId | The test group identifier | integer
| tests | The test case data, depending on the algorithm see <<cbc_mac_vs_tr_table>>, <<bc_df_vs_tr_table>>, or <<hash_df_vs_tr_table>> | array
|===

An example of this is the following

[source, json]
----
{
    "tgId": 1,
    "tests": [ ... ]
}
