=== Test Vector Responses

After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it *SHALL* send the response vectors back to the ACVP server within the alloted timeframe. The following table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set response.

.Vector Set Response JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type

| acvVersion | Protocol version identifier | string
| vsId | Unique numeric identifier for the vector set | integer
| testGroups | Array of JSON objects that represent each test vector result, which uses the same JSON schema as defined in <<tcjs>> | array of testGroup objects
|===

The testGroup Response section is used to organize the ACVP client response in a similar manner to how it receives vectors. Several algorithms *SHALL* require the client to send back group level properties in its response. This structure helps accommodate that.

.Vector Set Group Response JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type

| tgId | The test group identifier | integer
| tests | The tests associated to the group specified in tgId | array of testCase objects
|===

Each test case is a JSON object that represents a single test object to be processed by the ACVP client. The following table describes the JSON elements for each test case object.

.Test Case Results JSON Object
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type

| tcId | Numeric identifier for the test case, unique across the entire vector set | integer
| mac | The IUT's MAC response to an AFT for KMAC | hex
| testPassed | The IUT's reponse to an MVT for KMAC | boolean
| md | The IUT's digest response to an AFT | hex
| outLen | The output length of the digest | integer
| resultsArray | Array of JSON objects that represent each iteration of an MCT. Each iteration will contain the md and outLen | array of objects containing the md and outLen
|===

NOTE: The tcId *MUST* be included in every test case object sent between the client and the server.
