=== XOF Algorithm Capabilities Registration

This section describes the constructs for advertising support of XOFs to the ACVP server. ACVP *REQUIRES* cryptographic modules to register their capabilities in a registration. This allows the cryptographic module to advertise support for specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test vectors generated for the validation process.

The XOF capabilities *MUST* be advertised as JSON objects within the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message. The 'algorithms' value *MUST* be an array, where each array element is an individual JSON object defined in this section. The 'algorithms' value *MUST* be part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration message.

Each XOF algorithm capability advertised *SHALL* be a self-contained JSON object.

Each algorithm capability advertised is a self-contained JSON object.  The following JSON values are used for XOF algorithm capabilities:

[cols="<,<,<"]
[[caps_table]]
.XOF Algorithm Capabilities JSON Values
|===
| JSON Value | Description | JSON type

| algorithm | The algorithm and mode to be validated. | string
| revision | The algorithm testing revision to use. | string
| xof | Implementation has the ability to act as an XOF or a non-XOF algorithm | array of boolean
| hexCustomization | An optional feature to the implementation.  When true, "hex" customization strings are supported, otherwise they aren't.  ASCII strings *SHALL* be tested regardless of the value within the `hexCustomization` property. | boolean
| msgLen | Input length for the XOF | domain
| outputLen | Output length for the XOF | domain
| keyLen | Supported key lengths | domain
| macLen | Supported MAC lengths | domain
| blockSize | block size (in bytes) to be used with ParallelHash | domain
|===

The following grid outlines which properties are *REQUIRED*, as well as all the possible values a server *MAY* support for XOF algorithms:

NOTE: For cSHAKE, ParallelHash, and TupleHash, the value for the outputLen property must consist either of a single range object or a single literal value. This restriction is made to simplify the implementation of the Monte Carlo Tests for these algorithms (see <<MC_test>>).
