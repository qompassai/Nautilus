== Test Types and Test Coverage

This section describes the design of the tests used to validate {spec-algorithm} implementations.

=== Test Types

There is only one test type: functional tests. Each has a specific value to be used in the testType field. The testType field definition is:

* "AFT" - Algorithm Functional Test. These tests can be processed by the client using a normal 'derive_key' operation. AFTs cause the implementation under test to exercise normal operations on random data. The functional tests are designed to verify that the logical components of the key deriviation process are operating correctly.
