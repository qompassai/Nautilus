== Versioning

The version of the ACVP protocol will be carried with each message and will contain a simple major.minor format. Major version changes will not be backward compatible, however additions and enhancements that do not disrupt compatibility will be indicated with a minor version change. A server *MAY* accept a down-level version from the client if it can process at a lower level. If not, it will reject the session. All subsequent messages will carry the negotiated version value.
