The encoding used for the request/response messaging will be JSON (<<RFC7159>>). The data will be identified by: Content-type: application/json In order to allow environment specific extensions to a particular version of the ACV protocol, a top-level JSON keyword, extensions will be used to extend the OE description and/or the capabilities. Extensions *MAY* be ignored by the ACV server. Vector and vector response data will be JSON encoded.
