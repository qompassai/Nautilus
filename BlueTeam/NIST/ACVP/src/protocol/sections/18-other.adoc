When an ACVP client is attached to a cryptographic module that is in use, access to ACVP *MUST* be controlled so that only an administrator or other authorized user can send and receive ACVP messages. This is because an attacker that has access to ACVP can potentially use it to probe for weaknesses in the cryptographic module.
