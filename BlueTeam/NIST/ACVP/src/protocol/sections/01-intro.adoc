== Introduction

The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a software or hardware crypto module. It introduces a method to perform cryptographic
assessment and validations at a rate which meets typical industry development cycles; providing the ability to deploy validated crypto with CVE fixes much faster than previous methods.

The ACVP specification describes how the protocol is structured with respect to the client-server model, messaging, optional features, and flows. It defines how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server; including crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication, vector processing and more. The ACVP specification does not define algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto validation. A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.
