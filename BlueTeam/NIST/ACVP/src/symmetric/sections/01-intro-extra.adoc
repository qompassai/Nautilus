The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the block ciphers in order to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation. A typical ACVP validation session would require multiple tests to be performed for every supported cryptographic algorithm, such as AES-ECB, AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, TDES-CBC, TDES-CTR, etc.
