# Privacy Engineering Collaboration Space
The NIST Privacy Engineering Collaboration Space is an online venue open to the public where practitioners can discover, share, discuss, and improve upon open source tools, solutions, and processes that support privacy engineering and risk management.

## Focus Areas
We have launched this space with an initial focus on disassociability and privacy risk assessment tools and use cases, and welcome [feedback](mailto:collabspace@nist.gov) on topics of interest from the community. 

* **Disassociability:** a technique or process applied to a dataset with the goal of preventing or limiting certain types of privacy risks to individuals, protected groups, and establishments, while still allowing for the production of aggregate statistics. This focus area includes a broad scope of disassociability to allow for noise-introducing techniques such as differential privacy, data masking, and the creation of synthetic datasets that are based on privacy-preserving models.

* **Privacy Risk Assessment:** a process that helps organizations to analyze and assess privacy risks for individuals arising from the processing of their data. This focus area includes, but is not limited to, risk models, risk assessment methodologies, and approaches to determining privacy risk factors. 

## Contribute to the Space 

Contributions come in three categories:

1. **Tool:** A tool can be an open source solution or process, ranging from software to frameworks. 
2. **Use Case:** A use case is an example of an organization processing data about individuals for some explicit purpose(s) (e.g., where a goal is to prevent re-identification of the data during its processing, improve privacy risk assessment practices).
3. **Feedback:** Help the community. Provide feedback on tools and use cases.

Tools and use cases are contributed via pull requests, while feedback is contributed via issues. Contributed tools and use cases can be hosted directly in this repository, or you can host them elsewhere online and link to them from this repository.

### How to Contribute Tools and Use Cases

1. Fork a copy of USNISTGOV/PrivacyEngCollabSpace to your own organizational or personal space. 

2. Create a branch in your fork, named specifically for your contribution. 

3. In your branch: 

	A. Create a new directory within the relevant tool or use case directory: tools/disassociability, tools/risk-assessment, use-cases/disassociability, or use-cases/risk-assessment. Example: *tools/disassociability/[your-contribution-name]*

	B. Name the directory to describe your contribution. 

	C. Include in the directory a README.md file that follows the relevant [template](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates). There is a template for a [tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates/tool-template.md) and for a [use case](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates/use-case-template.md) contribution.

	D. If hosting a tool in this repository, also include in the directory any pertinent source code files or documentation. 

	E. Update the README.md file of the main directory to which you’re contributing. This README provides an index of that directory's contents. It should include an entry reflecting your contribution. 

5. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/pull/new/master) (PR) from your branch to the master branch in USNISTGOV/PrivacyEngCollabSpace. 

6. Moderators will then review the PR and may provide comments and suggestions to the contributor. 

### How to Contribute Feedback 

Submit an [issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/issues/new) to provide feedback on tools or use cases in the space. Please select appropriate tags related to the feedback.

## Operating Rules 

NIST will only accept open source submissions, per the Open Source Initiative’s [definition](https://opensource.org/osd) of “open source”. Upon submission, materials will be public, considered to be open source, and may be altered and shared. 

This is a moderated platform. NIST reserves the right to reject, remove, or edit any submission, including anything that: 

* promotes pay-for services or products;  
* includes personally identifiable or business identifiable information according to Department of Commerce Office of Privacy and Open Government [guidelines](http://www.osec.doc.gov/opog/privacy/PII_BII.html); 
* is inaccurate;  
* contains abusive or vulgar content, spam, hate speech, personal attacks, or similar content;
* is clearly "off topic"; 
* makes unsupported accusations; or, 
* contains .exe or .jar file types.* 

*These file types will not be merged into the NIST repository; instead, NIST may link to these if hosted elsewhere.
