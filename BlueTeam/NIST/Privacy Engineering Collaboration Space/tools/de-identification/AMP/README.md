# Approximate Minima Perturbation (AMP)

**Primary Focus Area:** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords:** Differential Privacy, Machine Learning

**Brief Description:** This work presents a novel algorithm called Approximate Minima Perturbation (AMP) for differentially private convex optimization, and an extensive empirical evaluation on real datasets of both AMP and a number of previous approaches for solving this problem. The Github repository contains Python implementations of AMP, noisy stochastic gradient descent, noisy Frank-Wolfe, objective perturbation, and two variants of output perturbation, as well as a number of benchmarks for generating experimental results.

**Additional Notes:** The AMP algorithm and associated experimental results are described in an IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2019 paper available [here](http://www.uvm.edu/~jnear/papers/TPDPCO.pdf).
