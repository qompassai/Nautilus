# Google Differential Privacy Library

**Primary Focus Area:** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords:** Differential Privacy

**Brief Description:** Google's differential privacy library provides a set of building block components that allow developers to build differentially private applications in C++, Java, and Go. Furthermore, Google's DP library offers 'Privacy on Beam', an end-to-end implementation of differential privacy that helps developers perform operations in a differentially private manner. [This codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/privacy-on-beam/#0) gives further insight.
