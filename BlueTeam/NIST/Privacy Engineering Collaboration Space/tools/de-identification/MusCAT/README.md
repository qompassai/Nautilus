**Primary Focus Area (select one):** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords (select any relevant):** Differential Privacy, Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption, Machine Learning, Federated Learning 

**Brief Description:**
MusCAT is a multi-scale, hybrid federated system for privacy-preserving epidemic surveillance and risk prediction. 
It combines differential privacy, multiparty homomorphic encryption, and federated learning to jointly analyze private data held by multiple federation units with formal privacy guarantees.
This software implements Team MusCAT's solution to the [U.S. PETs Prize Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/group/nist-federated-learning/) (Pandemic Forecasting).
Team MusCAT won [first place](https://drivendata.co/blog/federated-learning-pets-prize-winners-phase1) for the white paper (Phase 1) and [second place](https://drivendata.co/blog/federated-learning-pets-prize-winners-phases-2-3) in the final stage (Phase 2) of the Challenge.
