**Name of Tool: **Anomaly Detection via Privacy-Enhanced Two-Step Federated Learning

**Primary Focus Area (select one):** De-identification 

**De-identification Keywords (select any relevant):** Differential Privacy, Anonymization, Information Leakage, Federated Learning, Anomaly Detection, SMC

**Brief Description: ** We developed a novel privacy-preserving (PP) two-step federated learning approach to identify anomalous financial transactions. In the first step, we performed PP feature mining for account-level banks’ data, followed by their augmentation to the payment network’s data using a PP encoding scheme. In the second step, a classifier is learned by the messaging network from the augmented data. A key benefit of our approach is that the performance in the federated setting is comparable to the performance in the centralized setting, and there is no significant drop in accuracy. Furthermore, our approach is extremely flexible since it allows the messaging network to adapt its model and features to build a better classifier without imposing any additional computational or privacy burden on the banks.
