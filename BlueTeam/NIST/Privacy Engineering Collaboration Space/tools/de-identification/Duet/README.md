# Duet

**Primary Focus Area:** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords:** Differential Privacy, Verification of Algorithms, Machine Learning

**Brief Description:** Duet is a programming language which automatically derives (and checks) differential privacy bounds for programs written in the language. Duet is designed to support modern machine learning algorithms, and advanced variants of differential privacy in order to add minimal noise to algorithm results in order to ensure privacy.
