# Focus Areas
Tools and use cases are currently focused on disassociability and privacy risk assessment. We welcome [feedback](mailto:collabspace@nist.gov) on future topics of interest.

**Disassociability:** This focus area can help system designers and engineers consider how to enable the processing of personal information or events without association to individuals or devices beyond the operational requirements of the system. These tools and use cases also support the achievement of the Dissociated Processing Subcategory (CT.DP.P) of the NIST Privacy Framework. 

**Privacy Risk Assessment:** A process that helps organizations to analyze and assess privacy risks for individuals arising from the processing of their data. This focus area includes, but is not limited to, risk models, risk assessment methodologies, and approaches to determining privacy risk factors.
