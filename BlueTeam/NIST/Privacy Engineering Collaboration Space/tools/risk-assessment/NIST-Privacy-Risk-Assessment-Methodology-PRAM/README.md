# NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM)

**Brief Description:** The PRAM is a tool that applies the risk model from [NISTIR 8062](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062) and helps organizations analyze, assess, and prioritize privacy risks to determine how to respond and select appropriate solutions. The PRAM can help drive collaboration and communication between various components of an organization, including privacy, cybersecurity, business, and IT personnel.
