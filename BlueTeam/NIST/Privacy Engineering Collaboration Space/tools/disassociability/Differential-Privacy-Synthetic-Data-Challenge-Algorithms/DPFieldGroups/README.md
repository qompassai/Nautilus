<strong>Brief Description:</strong>

  This is the fourth place entry in the third round of the NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge.  The goal of this challenge is to produce differentially private synthetic data while retaining as much useful information as possible about the original data set.   Colorado census data from 1940 with 98 field columns were provided for algorithm development with census data from other states used for testing.
  
  This solution groups together fields which have been found to be highly correlated.  For each of these groups, a histogram is created for the purpose of counting the number of occurrences of every possible combination of values of all fields in the group. For privatization, Laplacian noise is added to every bin with scale proportional to the number of groups / total epsilon.  Synthetic data is generated by selecting a random bin for each group with probability weighted by these noisy bin counts.  The field values corresponding to each group's selected bin are written out as a single row of synthetic data.
