# GUPT: Privacy preserving data analysis made easy

**Primary Focus Area:** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords:** Differential Privacy, Machine Learning, Database Queries

**Brief Description:** The tool provides differential privacy guarantees to statistical/machine learning algorithms by treating the underlying algorithm as a black-box, and only relying on input/output signatures. It implements a variant of the celebrated sample and
aggregate framework by Nissim, Rashkhodnikova, and Smith, 2007. The empirical evaluation shows that the system scores well on various
learning tasks (like clustering and regression).

**Additional Notes:** GUPT is described in detail in a SIGMOD 2012 paper, titled "GUPT: Privacy Preserving Data Analysis Made Easy." A  PDF is [available here](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~elaine/docs/gupt.pdf).
