# Chorus

**Primary Focus Area:** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords:** Differential Privacy

**Brief Description:** Chorus is a tool for answering SQL queries with differential privacy. Chorus works with a standard SQL database, and scales to large datasets by offloading the heavy lifting of query answering to the database. To implement differential privacy mechanisms, Chorus uses a combination of query rewriting and post-processing.

**Additional Notes:** 
- Chorus is described in a EuroS&P paper available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230409).
