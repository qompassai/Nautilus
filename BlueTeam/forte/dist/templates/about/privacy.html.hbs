        The public keyserver running on forte.qompass.ai processes, stores and
        distributes OpenPGP key data. The specific way in which data is processed
        differs by type as follows:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Email Addresses</b>
              <p>Email addresses contained in <abbr title="Packet Tag 13">User
                      IDs</abbr> are personally identifiable information (PII).
                  Special care is taken to make sure they are used only with
                  consent:
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          Publishing requires <a target="_blank"
                              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-in_email#Confirmed_opt-in_(COI)_/_Double_opt-in_(DOI)">double
                              opt-in</a> validation, to prove ownership of the
                          email address in question.
                      </li>
                      <li>Addresses are searchable by exact email address,
                          but not by associated name.</li>
                      <li>Enumeration of addresses is not possible.</li>
                      <li>Deletion of addresses is possible via simple proof
                          of ownership in an automated fashion, similar to
                          publication. To unlist an address where this isn't
                          possible, write to support at keys dot openpgp dot
                          org.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
              </p>
              <p>This data is never handed collectively ("as a dump") to third
                  parties.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Public Key Data</b>
              <p>The cryptographic content of OpenPGP keys is not considered personally
                  identifiable information. This includes specifically
                  <abbr title="Packet Tags 6 and 14">public key material</abbr>,
                  <abbr title="Packet Tag 2, Signature types 0x10-0x13, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1F">self-signatures</abbr>, and
                  <abbr title="Packet Tag 2, Signature types 0x20, 0x28, 0x30">revocation signatures</abbr>.
              </p>
              <p>This data is not usually collectively available ("as
                  a dump"), but may be handed upon request to third
                  parties for purposes of development or research.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Other User ID data</b>
              <p>An OpenPGP key may contain personal data other than email
                  addresses, such as <abbr title="Packet Tag 13">User IDs</abbr>
                  that do not contain email addresses, or <abbr
                  title="Packet Tag 17">image attributes</abbr>. This data is stripped
              during upload and never stored, processed, or distributed in
              any way.
              </p>
              <p>OpenPGP packet types that were not specifically mentioned above are
                  stripped during upload and never stored, processed or
                  distributed in any way.
              </p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left">Data is never relayed to third parties outside of
          what is available from the <a href="/about/api">public API interfaces</a>,
          and what is described in this policy.
