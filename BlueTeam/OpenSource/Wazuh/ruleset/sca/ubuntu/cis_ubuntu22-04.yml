    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab or tmp.mount. Example of /etc/fstab configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Example of tmp.mount configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options: [Unit] Description=Temporary Directory /tmp ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=!/tmp DefaultDependencies=no Conflicts=umount.target Before=local-fs.target umount.target After=swap.target [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var."
    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follow. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behaviour. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection from exploitation An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

  # 2.1.4.1 Ensure ntp access control is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 28548
    title: "Ensure ntp access control is configured."
    description: 'ntp Access Control Commands: restrict address [mask mask] [ippeerlimit int] [flag ...] The address argument expressed in dotted-quad form is the address of a host or network. Alternatively, the address argument can be a valid host DNS name. The mask argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, meaning that the address is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry (address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the list. Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry. The ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of -1 means "unlimited", the current default. A value of 0 means "none". There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified: - kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o''-death (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped. - limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag. - lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps. - noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric key for authentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field of the ntp.keys file. This restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain backward compatibility. Expect noepeer to become the default in ntp-4.4. - nomodify - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries which attempt to modify the state of the server (i.e., run time reconfiguration). Queries which return information are permitted. - noquery - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries. Time service is not affected. - nopeer - Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new association. This includes broadcast and symmetric active packets when a configured association does not exist. It also includes pool associations, so if you want to use servers from a pool directive and also want to use nopeer by default, you''ll want a restrict source ... line as well that does not include the nopeer directive. - noserve - Deny all packets except ntpq and ntpdc queries. - notrap - Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the ntpq control message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging programs. - notrust - Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated. - ntpport - This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port (123). Both ntpport and non-ntpport may be specified. The ntpport is considered more specific and is sorted later in the list.'
    rationale: "If ntp is in use on the system, proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is accurate."
    remediation: "Add or edit restrict lines in /etc/ntp.conf to match the following: restrict -4 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery OR If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove ntp from the system: # apt purge ntp."

    description: 'Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs.

"SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.'
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system.

    rationale: "There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept, the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will continue transversing the network stack. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage. Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system."
    impact: "If configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of connectivity. Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base chain's policy to drop."
    remediation: "Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks to implement a default DROP policy: # nft chain <table family> <table name> <chain name> { policy drop \\; } Example: # nft chain inet filter input { policy drop \\; } # nft chain inet filter forward { policy drop \\; } # nft chain inet filter output { policy drop \\; }."

    description: "RSyslog will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls what permissions will be applied to these newly created files."
    rationale: "It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected."
    impact: "The systems global umask could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the FileCreateMode directive. RSyslog also has it's own $umask directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how FileCreateMode is used. Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in /etc/rsyslog.conf, /etc/rsyslog.d/*conf files and that FileCreateMode is set before any file is created."
    remediation: "Edit either /etc/rsyslog.conf or a dedicated .conf file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ and set $FileCreateMode to 0640 or more restrictive: $FileCreateMode 0640 Restart the service: # systemctl restart rsyslog."

  # 5.2.16 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled. (Automated)
  - id: 28647
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

  # 5.2.22 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 28653
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "NOTE: To clarify, the two settings described below is only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they where abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: - ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinately, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. Example: ClientAliveInterval 15 ClientAliveCountMax 3."

The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism.

    description: "Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are made to the common PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM. All configuration of faillock is located in /etc/security/faillock.conf and well commented. - deny - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds n tries. - fail_interval - The length of the interval, in seconds, during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account to be locked out - unlock_time - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock command. Set the lockout number and unlock time in accordance with local site policy."
    rationale: "Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force password attacks against your systems."

    description: "Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Note: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
