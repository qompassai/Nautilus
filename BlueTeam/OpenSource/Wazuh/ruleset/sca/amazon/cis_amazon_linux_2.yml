    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexecoption on the mount, making /tmpuseless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuidprogram and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."

System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network"
