    # The current assumptions for measurement:
    #   1. we only do measure once throughout a gate sequence, and itâ€™s done at the end of the sequence
    #   2. measure is applied to first x (most likely x=all) qubits in the circuit
    # When we introduce benchmarks that do mid-circuit measurement, we must revisit the assumption!
