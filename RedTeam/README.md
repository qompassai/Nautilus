## Purpose

This project aims to provide educational resources for ethical hacking and cybersecurity, with a focus on:

1. Implementing and understanding Purple Llama for AI safety and security testing.
2. Exploring Flipper Unleashed firmware for hardware security research.
3. Aligning cybersecurity practices with NIST guidelines and standards.

Our goal is to foster a deeper understanding of cybersecurity principles and promote responsible security testing practices.

## Usage

### Purple Llama

Purple Llama is used for AI model evaluation and security testing. When using Purple Llama:
